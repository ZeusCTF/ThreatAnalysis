This attack hinges upon a user falling for the phishing and opening the provided .zip file.  
Earlier reports suggested that attackers compromised credentials by imitating subdomains for official portals, which is likely a contributing factor towards the success of this attack.  
An organization unfortunately has limited options when it comes to detecting these “lookalike domains”, with perhaps the most common response being employee education.  
Other explored avenues might include a WAF implementation with custom rulesets to prevent a user from accessing suspicious websites, but effectiveness of this method is dependent on the ruleset and overall implementation.  
Other ideas may include routine domain monitoring, however this requires vigilance on the part of an organization’s administrators, and any reliance upon purely human protection is often susceptible in one way or another.  
Ideally, some combination of each preventative measure is enacted, in which an organization routinely provides engaging security awareness training along with frequent domain monitoring (perhaps in an automated manner) and implements a WAF to catch requests leading out to domains not specifically allowed.
